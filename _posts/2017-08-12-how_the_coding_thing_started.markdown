Five years ago, I was an idealistic, passionate, yet uncertain piano performance major in college. 

"You'll never make money in music," said lots of people. "You need to get a real job." 

I can't even count the number of times I heard that. After hearing those words enough times, I started to wonder, "What COULD I do if I wasn't doing music?" 

After a good deal of research and asking around, I settled on computer science. Creating stuff? Check. Demand for patience, attention to detail, and logic? Check. Not especially heavy on the demand for people skills? Check. Real-job-ish-ness? Check. 

My first course of action was to sign up for Computer Science 101 in college, which was a mistake. The class spent most of their time watching robotics videos and listening to the professor talk about his new Nissan Leaf. Yawn. I can't think of one thing I learned. I left feeling discouraged about computer science, and that was the end of my adventure in coding for a long time. I went forward with my piano performance major and eventually graduated. 

It turns out all those people who said I'd never make money in music were wrong. I landed a pretty sweet job as a church music director a few months after graduation. I learned a lot from that job, mainly that it takes more than "passion for music" to love your music job. We regularly hear that passion isn't enough to sustain a lifelong marriage, so why don't we hear the same thing about a lifelong career?  

I started looking for "something more" from my career. I tried part-time graduate school, hoping that a higher degree would land me the elusive "better job." After starting grad school, I also remembered my interest in computer science and started looking for ways to learn coding on my own. I planned to slowly teach myself coding alongside my graduate studies. I was trying to grow in any way I could.

After just one semester of grad school, the school abruptly closed, due to crippling debt. That's when I started to think about studying code seriously. I was particularly attracted to The Flatiron School's Women Take Tech Scholarship and their flexible online program that allowed me to keep my full-time job. I made the leap to apply and now, after being accepted and receiving the scholarship I aimed for, I am so glad that I did.

Where is this adventure going? How am I going to balance my passion for music with my interest in coding? Will I find the Holy Grail of The Job I Love? I don't know! That's why it's an adventure. Come join me.
